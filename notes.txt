Attempt test driven development - identify all of the use cases

Understand this line in more detail:
const HomePage({super.key});


UI things to do:
3) Tests for basic calculations - create state machine
  a) calculation and result add in test
4) When too many characters - decrease size of characters
  a) Decide a maximum number of chars
5) Floating point multiplication and division issues handle = division by 3
6) disallow landscope mode
7) divide by 0 issue resolve

Evalution cases later on - eval pressing 0 at zero state and how other numbers are different

Add case:
type decimals -> ac -> type decimals again



DONE
1) Height of buttons need to be updated to match actual calc app
2) Button touchable area needs to increase - I should always touch some button
  a) The on touch has a circle - make it this way
5) Equal sign style match
6) Add a bit of space from the bottom
  a) dot needs to be moved up a bit
4) Add line on top of keypad
3) Add test case for back button
  a) Add a back button on the app
7) Create calculation sections: calculation and result
  a) Create test case for initial 0
1) Initial state of just a 0 in front
5) Empty button must not be tapable
2) On pressing on charaters - replace 0 with character (only numbers)
  a) handle multiple number presses
Side notes:
- add test for AC and C as well
